# Essential Education Yum Repository
The intent of this repository is to provide package management for software
that is either poorly managed by the package maintainer in distributions, or
the package has no proper repo upstream.

The hope is that this repository is redundant and can go away as better
maintainers appear, or upstream figures out their packaging issues.
